# SceneGraph Change Workflow

1. Identify whether the change owns the Unity exporter, TOML parser/schema, TypeScript parser, rules, validator, CLI, or CI.
2. Read `docs/repository-guide.md`, `docs/architecture/data-flow.md`, and `docs/schema/scene-graph-toml.md` before changing a cross-package contract.
3. Keep the smallest compatible change. Preserve existing TOML keys unless an ADR describes the migration.
4. Add a focused fixture or test for the changed behavior. Include a negative case when the change affects static analysis.
5. For exporter changes, verify full export and selected/delta export separately.
6. For analyzer changes, run `npm run verify` in `packages/ts-analyzer`.
7. Update the schema document, roadmap, or ADR when behavior or compatibility changes.
8. Report the changed contract, tests run, and any Unity-only validation that was unavailable.

## Local re-export and analysis check

Use this flow whenever the sample Unity project (`packages/unity-semantic-graph/Samples~`) changes (new GameObject, new script wiring, new component) and you need to confirm `SceneGraph.toml` and the analyzer agree with it.

1. Add/change the GameObject or script in the Unity Editor GUI yourself (do not fabricate scene content via a one-off Editor C# script — edit the actual `.unity` scene through Unity).
2. Re-export `SceneGraph.toml` from the batch command documented in `docs/repository-guide.md`:
   ```powershell
   & "<UnityEditorPath>\Unity.exe" -batchmode -quit `
     -projectPath "packages/unity-semantic-graph/Samples~" `
     -executeMethod UnitySemanticGraph.Editor.Exporter.SelectiveComponentTomlExporter.ExportGraphToToml `
     -scenePath "Assets/test.unity" `
     -outputPath "Assets/SceneGraph.toml"
   ```
   Exit code `0` means success; `1` means the export failed (check the Unity log for the reason).
3. If the exporter method can't be found or the package won't resolve, check `Samples~/Packages/manifest.json`: the `com.azuki.unity-semantic-graph` dependency is a git URL pointing at this repository. If the repo was renamed on GitHub, update that URL (and the local `origin` remote) to match, then re-run step 2 so Unity re-resolves the package and regenerates `Samples~/Packages/packages-lock.json`.
4. Confirm the new/changed GameObject appears in `SceneGraph.toml` (e.g. `grep` for its path or script asset name). Note: `Samples~/Assets/SceneGraph.toml` is untracked (matched by `*~` in `.github/skills` context / gitignore) — it's a local fixture, not committed.
5. Run the TypeScript analyzer against the updated TOML and the relevant ClusterScript (see `docs/repository-guide.md` "Export and Analyze" section, or `npm run verify` in `packages/ts-analyzer` for the full unit-test suite) to confirm the constraint check passes/fails as expected.
6. Report: what scene content changed, the export exit code, the resulting TOML diff (GameObject/components), and the analyzer result.
